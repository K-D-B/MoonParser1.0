### brief introduction

This is a team project for TJCS 100395. In this project,  we write a rudimentary parser based on a LR(1) grammar which has only 78 productions. We completed this project using C++ language and Qt5.9.9 framework.

 All source code and executable program have been placed in the corresponding folders . And the executable program ***parser_front.exe*** can be executed on bare computers with Windows .
